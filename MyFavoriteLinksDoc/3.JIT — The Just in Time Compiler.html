<h3>JIT — The Just in Time Compiler</h3>

Even if opcodes are in the form of low-level intermediate representation, they still have to be compiled into machine
code. JIT “doesn’t introduce any additional IR (Intermediate Representation) form”, but uses DynASM (Dynamic Assembler
for code generation engines) to generate native code directly from PHP byte-code.

In short, JIT translates the hot parts of the intermediate code into machine code. Bypassing compilation, it’d be able
to bring considerable improvements in performance and memory usage.

Zeev Surasky, co-author of the PHP JIT proposal, shows how much calculations would be faster with JIT:
